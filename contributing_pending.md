| Google | Library related to google |
| Android | Library related to android |
|Firebase | Library related to firebase api|
|Test |Library related to test app|

##### Indentation


 Switch case
```
#!java
Align by  such as these cases :

Switch(value){
    case 0:
       // Todo action here
    break;
    Default:
       // Todo default action here
    break;
}
```
If / else or else if
```
#!java

if(value.toString().equals("Hello")){
  //To do action here
}else if{
  // To do action here
} else{
  // Todo
}

```
**Remember: **

* The attributes of the class must be protected or private

* The Method of the class must be public, private or protected

* The class must be public or private

### Naming ###
** Name:** That must be transparent and representative about the action to show us.

**Class:** should be nouns in UpperCamelCase, with the first letter of every word capitalized.
example :

```
#!java
public class Json(){

}
```
**variable:** 	Local variables, instance variables, and class variables are also written in lowerCamelCase.

example :

```
#!java

String name =" Carl";
String fileName="json.txt";
```

**Constant:** Constants should be written in uppercase characters separated by underscores.

example :


```
#!java

public static final String CONSTANT_NAME=" fileName.txt";
```

#### Firebase index:

This is the Three in firebase :

```
#!code
